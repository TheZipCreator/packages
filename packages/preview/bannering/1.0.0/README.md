# Bannering
Bannering is a Typst extension to write Minecraft banners. This was created so
that documents could be typeset for [Clongcraft](https://linktr.ee/clongcraft),
but it may have other uses too.

## Banner formats
This package has a few different ways to specify banners:
* Banner codes: you can get the banner code for a banner by either constructing
  it with the Clongcraft bot, or by running `/getbannercode` in-game on the
  Clongcraft server.
* Banner writer links: You can use a link to an image containing a single banner
  created by [Electra's Banner Writer](https://banner-writer.web.app/). You can
  get the link by pressing "Link".

## Example
```typst
// set text size
#set text(size: 48pt)

// create a dictionary of banners
#let latin = banner-dict((
	"H": "https://banner-writer.web.app/image/R.3mno.png",
	"E": "https://banner-writer.web.app/image/R.3mpni.png",
	"L": "https://banner-writer.web.app/image/R.3mi.png",
	"O": "https://banner-writer.web.app/image/R.3impo.png"
))

// render our banners
#banners(latin, "H E L L O")

// you can also render a single banner directly:
#banner("b0bt14tt11")

// multiple lines are supported
#banners(latin, "L O
O L")
```

## Documentation
### `banner-dict(dict) -> dict`
Creates a banner dictionary. You should use this whenever possible instead of
rendering individual banners as this pre-renders all banners before placing them
in the document.

The dictionary should consist of entries where the key is the word name and the
value is the banner text (used in the same way as `banner`).
### `banner(code: str) -> content`
Renders a single banner at this position.

Whether the code is a banner writer URL or a banner code is automatically
determined.
### `banners(dict, str, disable-spacing: bool = true) -> content`
Renders multiple banners, as defined by `dict` (which should be a banner
dictionary generated by `banner-dict`.)

Whitespace is preserved. Any banner not in the dictionary is rendered as normal
text.

By default, this embeds the rendered banner result in some `text` and `par`
rules for better spacing. If you want to use your own spacing instead, you may
set `disable-spacing` to `true` to return the raw content.

## Building and installation
Running `./build` will build the package into the folder `package`. Linux users
may install it to `@local` by running `./install`.
